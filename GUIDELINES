  1.  Use a 16x16 primary canvas. 
  2.  Snap to grids for clean shapes. 
  3.  Stick to the metaphor of the full-color set whenever possible. 
  4.  Reuse icons available in GNOME symbolic-icons or parts of them whenever possible. 
  5.  Use as simple of a shape as possible, switching from perspective to head on when needed. 
  6.  Omit non-defining details and focus on one shape, do not use tiny labels or numbers. 
  7.  If possible use a 2px outline. 
  8.  Never use fonts in the outcome, draw the characters with snapping to grids in mind when needed. 
  9.  Use #bebebe as the color to your icons, if a secondary shade is needed or showing inactivity is desired use the %35 opacity of the same color. 
  10. Add a blank 16x16 square centered on top of your finished icon and group it with it. 
  11. Test the outcome in 16x16 and scaled up dimensions. 
  12. Follow the standard icons naming.
  13. Group, layer, and name the icon area placeholder according to https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Design/User_Experience/Tools section SVG Icon / Graphics Workflow, so that we can extract and convert them by script.
